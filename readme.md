#Basic Ass Gan ( or BAG for short ).
### By David Redmon

This is my basic ass vanilla MNIST GAN( or generative adversarial network ). It will be far from
perfect or even good, but it will be. 
This project will consist of three folders: 
 - input
 - outputs
 - src

	Input - The MNIST Dataset
	Outputs - the discriminated generator output
	src - the source code

This project was led by a tutorial on debugger cafe [debuggercafe.com]
specifically [https://debuggercafe.com/generating-mnist-digit-images-using-vanilla-gan-with-pytorch/] 
By Mr. Sovit Ranjan Rath, Thank you for your tutorial, good sir!

Anyways, here we go!

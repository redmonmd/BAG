# Basic Ass Gan ( or BAG for short ).
### By David Redmon

This is my basic ass GAN( or generative adversarial network ) or bag for short. It will be far from
perfect or even good, but it will be. 
This project will consist of three folders: 
 - input -- the folder where the MNIST handwritten dataset will be downloaded and saved.
 - outputs -- the foldere where the generated images will be saved.
 - src -- where the source code is located, majority of commits will be here.

## TODO
 [ ] Unknown error with the generator, causing it to not learn on anything
 [X] Fix minor bugs with tensor sizes, etc
 [ ] A little more commenting in code is neccisary

There will be a decent room for improvement, I do not plan to archive this project for awhile.
If you would like to help, please feel free to send a pull request.

Anyways, here we go!
-DR
